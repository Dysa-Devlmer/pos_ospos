## What Was Wrong

The OSPOS database was missing critical components:

1. **Missing database column**: `menu_group` column in grants table
2. **Missing modules**: home, office, expenses, cashups, attributes modules
3. **Incorrect permissions**: Missing or incorrectly assigned permissions
4. **Missing tables**: Several tables required by modules didn't exist
5. **Wrong configuration**: Module menu groups not properly set
